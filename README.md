## WriteDontThink editor.js fork

This fork of editor.js is a customized editor for my project WriteDontThink. The following are the goals of this customization: 

- Give each block its own unique ID (this will allow server side document processing to process individual blocks instead of a whole document)
- Remove visible block divisions, and present a seamless document editing experience to a user

If any of these features seem useful to you, feel free to use my changes.
